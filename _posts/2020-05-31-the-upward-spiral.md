He unleashes wrath and
<br/>torment
<br/>Destruction ensues his trail
<br/>He despises the witch who
<br/>creates.

Benevolent and brave
<br/>Her stride invokes awe
<br/>As she fosters universes
<br/>Her kindness knows no
<br/>bounds.

He looks into the void of
<br/>fringe
<br/>Waiting is a fool’s game
<br/>Purpose is lost forever
<br/>His time never comes.

She longs to make a new
<br/>enclave
<br/>Her fingertips wave and
<br/>spew the essence
<br/>As she blesses another
<br/>With chance and love. 

Aimless and forlorn
<br/>He finds the goddess
<br/>concocting yet another world
<br/>Turns to her with fire in the
<br/>eyes and soul.

She melts his fury,
<br/>and burns the void
<br/>She consoles and he
<br/>confides in her the future.
<br/>Instance of eons in clarity
<br/>All that’s needed is infinity.

Together they set out
<br/>Spreading life as we know 
<br/>Minds collide and mingle
<br/>As they fly and sparkle
<br/>Hoping for something
<br/>divine.

Worlds everywhere set
<br/>ablaze
<br/>Teeming with hope and
<br/>power
<br/>Knowing they will get their
<br/>time to prosper.
